    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will build a pipeline to extract structured data from Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public health data is often published as Word/PDF files rather than clean machine-readable tables. Scraping lets us convert these semi-structured documents into analyzable datasets.\n",

    "## When is scraping useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use scraping when:\n",
    "- data is publicly available but not downloadable as a single table,\n",
    "- information is spread across many files/pages,\n",
    "- repeated document layouts contain fields you can systematically parse.\n"

    "1. Inspect the CCR layout and identify where key fields appear (paragraphs vs tables).\n",
    "2. Review the Python tools used for document parsing and cleaning.\n",
    "3. Build a scraper that extracts relevant fields from each CCR.\n",
    "4. Parse and standardize extracted values into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "5. Run quality checks for missing or inconsistent values.\n",
    "6. Export a tidy CSV for later analysis.\n"

Immuno-compromised persons such as those with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).\n",
      "Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).\n",
      "The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) included rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.\n",
      "Contaminants that may be present in sources water before we treat it include:\n",
      "Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, livestock operations and wildlife.\n",
      "Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-occurring or result from urban storm water runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming.\n",
      "Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as storm water run-off, agriculture, and residential users.\n",
      "Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or the result of mining activity.\n",
      "Organic contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and also come from gas stations, urban storm water run-off, and septic systems.\n",
      "In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulation which limits the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. We treat our water according to EPA’s regulations. Food and Drug Administration regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water, which must provide the same protection for public health.\n",
      "Our water system is required to test a minimum of 2 samples per month in accordance with the Revised Total Coliform Rule for microbiological contaminants. Coliform bacteria are usually harmless, but their presence in water can be an indication of disease-causing bacteria. When coliform bacteria are found, special follow-up tests are done to determine if harmful bacteria are present in the water supply. If this limit is exceeded, the water supplier must notify the public.\n",

The presence of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate the water poses a health risk.  Unless noted, the data presented in this table is from the testing done January 1- December 31, 2024.  The state requires us to monitor for certain contaminants less than once per year because the concentrations of these contaminants are not expected to vary significantly from year to year.
